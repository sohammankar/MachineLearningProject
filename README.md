# Dataset Overview
This dataset provides information about various stores belonging to a supermarket chain. These supermarkets are large self-service outlets offering a broad range of food, beverages, and household goods. They are more extensive than traditional grocery stores but smaller and with a more limited selection than hypermarkets or big-box stores. In the U.S., the terms "supermarket" and "grocery store" are often used interchangeably to describe these outlets.

# Dataset Details
The data includes metrics for different supermarket stores, each identified by a unique positive integer as their Store ID.

- Store ID: Unique identifier for each store.
- Store_Area: The physical size of the store in square yards.
- Items_Available: The total number of different items that the store stocks.
- Daily_Customer_Count: The average number of customers visiting the store per month.
- Store_Sales: The total sales generated by the store in U.S. dollars.

# Supermarket Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes supermarket data to uncover trends and insights using Python. The analysis covers key performance metrics like sales, customer behavior, and store performance. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Supermarket_Analysis.ipynb`) with an interactive HTML version for easy sharing.

## Results and Insights

### Key Findings

1. **Top-Performing Categories**: Fresh produce and dairy are consistently the highest-selling product categories.  
2. **Revenue Trends**: Sales peak during holiday seasons and weekends, with a noticeable 30% increase in revenue compared to regular days.  
3. **Customer Behavior**: Loyal customers contribute significantly to revenue, while promotional discounts are effective at attracting new buyers.  
4. **Store Performance**: Urban stores outperform rural stores due to higher footfall and diverse product offerings.
